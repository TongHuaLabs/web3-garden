Greetings Shade community,

The Shade Protocol Airdrop Calculator is LIVE!

The Shade Calculator is the result of hours of hard work and feedback from a range of Shade contributors — providing one of the smoothest multichain calculator experiences to date. The calculator empowers users to import and check their individual wallets for the SHD airdrop, with automated wallet detection turning the calculation process into a seamless user experience.

There were four categories attached to the airdrop: base airdrop amount, qualified node staking bonus (as specified in the original airdrop blog), and a small 0.1% of airdrop for those that staked with core Shade Protocol network contributors. Finally, Shade Protocol implemented a whale cap on each of the individual network as well as whale splitting anomaly wallet address detection and correlation.
