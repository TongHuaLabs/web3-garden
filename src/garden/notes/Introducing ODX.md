# Introducing $ODX

![introducing odx](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*C7xgLs-6H_wgaxlyBNINyA.png)

## Purpose
An SRC20 token deployed on the Cirrus sidechain of Stratis managed and distributed by an autonomous governance protocol through liquidity mining and vault certificates. Used for staking in enabled liquidity pools to vote for liquidity mining and collect partial transaction fees to offset risks and gas costs of using the protocol.

## Governance
For an AMM protocol to be successful, it must have sufficient liquidity to settle token swaps without high slippage and price impact. Liquidity providers lend tokens to liquidity pool smart contracts with the intention of collecting transaction fees from swaps and loans. This approach alone can be problematic because low liquidity results in high volatility and high liquidity requires steady transaction volume.

## Risk Mitigation
ODX can also be used to offset network gas costs and mitigate risk of using the core protocol. All smart contract transactions incur a gas cost that goes to miners securing the blockchain and under certain conditions, traders can experience slippage and price impact while liquidity providers can experience impermanent loss when prices have diverged from their original entry point.
