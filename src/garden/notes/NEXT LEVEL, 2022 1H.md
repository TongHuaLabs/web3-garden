Dear Community,

We have some news: about the FUTURE.

# We will be releasing our 2022 1st halfâ€™s game lineups next Friday at Christmas Eve!

We have not one, but multiple games each with distinct game plays and genre prepared for you. And yes, one of those games is from an AAA studio.

The biggest and wildest game you have never seen in the crypto scene. To be frank, we see it as the best blend of PvP and intense earning. At the same time, other games are equally fun to play, if not even more exciting. They will provide extraordinary game play based on globally renown IPs or newly developed (unreleased) IPs.

We are more than excited to share this news. Starting with LOM, we are just getting our engine started for a great journey throughout 2022. We will continue to grow our pool of partnered studios and will never stop bringing the most value to our community.

As much as we have been silent the past month, we sincerely wish that what we have prepared next week will fit your taste and go beyond your expectations. It is, after all, almost the event of the year and we wish you all the best crypto experience next year.

Cannot wait for Christmas Eve

Stay warm ITAMies,

**ITAM team**
