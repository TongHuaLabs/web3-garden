# Emeris — The Road to Public Launch

![emeris](emeris.png)

Since the launch of **Emeris Beta** in September 2021, we’ve been hard at work. In fact, many new features and general improvements are almost ready to be rolled out, but we don’t want to rush things. We want to deliver a professional product with a truly superlative user experience — and we need a few more months to get there. To ensure that the platform is stable enough to lift the Beta label and go public, we’re announcing a new public launch window of Spring 2022.

Not to worry, though! There will be plenty happening on Emeris before then! Starting in January, we will begin releasing major upgrades on Emeris Beta, which we believe will bring a lot of value to users of the Interchain. Read on to find out more!

## The Emeris Mission: Bringing the Best of the Internet of Blockchains to the Masses

The Internet of Blockchains is already here. Every week, new chains are launching and connecting through _interoperability protocols like IBC._ These are exciting times for crypto users, and opportunities are plenty. Yet, with this cross-chain innovation, new UX and UI challenges must be addressed if the Interchain is to reach its full potential. That’s what Emeris is all about.

The Internet of Blockchains deserves first-class, professional-looking interfaces. That’s what we’re building with Emeris. Our long-term goal is to become one of the reference interfaces of the Internet of Blockchains, but, in the short term, we will mainly focus on providing a professional cross-chain dashboard for the Cosmos ecosystem (and beyond). Specifically, we will focus on the following areas:

- **Portfolio visualization:** As assets are starting to move around from blockchain to blockchain via interoperability protocols, it’s becoming harder and harder for users to keep track of their holdings. One of Emeris’ core focus areas is to provide a clear overview of users’ digital asset holdings across all supported chains, as well as useful metrics and data to give a clear picture of their portfolio performance.

- **Digital asset management:** Emeris will come with all the basic features that crypto users have come to expect, like asset transfers (including cross-chain transfers), staking (when applicable), and swapping. Better yet, the swapping feature will be powered by the first cross-chain DEX aggregator, enabling users to discover many new assets and benefit from the best possible swap price across the Interchain.

## Emeris Browser Extension

In addition to the features described above, the public launch of Emeris will mark the official release of the Emeris browser extension, a key management solution that works seamlessly with the Emeris web dashboard. Why did we decide to build our own browser extension?

- **Chain support:** Most browser extensions out there today are built to support specific ecosystems (Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, etc.). This creates complicated UX patterns when the web apps that use them want to give access to other ecosystems. Since the Emeris web app is built to be blockchain-agnostic, we quickly realized that having a chain-agnostic extension built from scratch would be necessary to maximize its usability.

- **Experiment with different UX/UI patterns:** By integrating third-party browser extensions, we depend on them to provide the UI and UX for wallet management and transaction signing. This limits us when it comes to providing a unified onboarding journey for new users as we have to align the UX of the app with the UX of the wallet (Emeris takes an asset-first approach, while Keplr takes a chain-first approach, for example). More generally, integrating with a third-party browser limits our ability to experiment with new features and UX patterns.
