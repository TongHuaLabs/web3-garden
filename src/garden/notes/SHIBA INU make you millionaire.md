## What Is Shiba

Shiba is an Erc20 token on the Ethereum network. İt started out as a meme token similar to dogecoin, and it was primarily marketed as the dogecoin killer. İn its early days, and was going after the same investors that held dogecoin in their personal investment portfolios.

They are both based on the same breed of dog, the Shiba Inu, which I think is referenced as the screaming Japanese dog.

From looking at Shib over the last eight months, I would say it no longer tries to be a dogecoin killer has carved out an entirely different market segment versus what dogecoin is and what dogecoin does.

## Shiba Ecosystem

Shibarium, it’s most likely a layered two on top of the Ethereum network to reduce fees for the overall Shiba ecosystem that they’re developing and all the different things that they’re kind of building on top of the Shiba Inu brand.

That’s the first big thing that’s coming out is kind of a layer two for Ethereum to reduce the fees to make it cheaper for their holders to be able to trade.

Because right now, if you’re trading Shiba token and you’re only trading like five-ten dollars, you’re spending more on Ethereum fees just to make that trade, and it’s just not. It makes the Shiba token that much more harder and a bigger barrier of entry for most people.

**Shi,** it is supposed to be a stable coin on the Shibarium system.

**Shibanet,** a decentralized marketplace.

**Shibaswap** V2, coming out.

Hopefully, the big listing that they’re hoping to get on for a centralized exchange is **Robinhood.**
