# $STARLY Token: Status Update

![starly](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RWR-iUVN35rt3AoXcqvaPw.jpeg)

There have been a lot of questions regarding $STARLY token launch date, utility, technical design and other aspects. This is a quick update on the latest decisions regarding our token launch, while we are still working to realign it with our vision, mission and Feng shui.

## Technical Design

First of all, we want to thank our partners Blocto and Flow for the advice and support in this journey.

It is confirmed that we are going ahead with the genesis token mint on Flow blockchain. It will be bridged to Binance Smart Chain using Blocto teleport. $STARLY token will be also bridged to Solana and Ethereum blockchains shortly after the initial exchange listing to keep up with the market needs.

Currently we work on the finishing touches of the $STARLY token’s technical design to hand it in for the review to the Flow team. We aim to finish this technical exercise in less than 2 weeks to be ready for the exchange listing in January (date will be confirmed via our official Twitter @StarlyNFT).

We also closely monitor market activity to pick the exact new listing date in the uptrend. The exchange team asked us not to mention their name until a few days before listing.

## Launchpad and Allocations

We have decided to spread our IDO on multiple platforms to engage all partner communities. 0.75% of $STARLY tokens will be sold across three venues:

- OccamRazer — 15th January 2022;
- DAO Maker —mid of January 2022 (exact date TBA);
- On a FLOW IDO platform —mid of January 2022 (exact date TBA)

**Best of all, we have decided to allocate a share of $STARLY tokens to reward our top collectors and other most active Starly users. We will elaborate this initiative in a separate medium post in the coming days.**

The initial utility of the $STARLY token can be found here. Our mission is to continuously evolve our token as a centerpiece of the Starly ecosystem to benefit creators, collectors and token holders.
