# Intro to Backalley

Backalley is a launchpad platform built on the Kadena blockchain to democratize access to fundraising through a fair, secure, cheap, and fast decentralized platform. We build on the “fixed swap” pools model, which guarantees fairness by fixing the swap price, benefiting investors and pool owners through more price transparency and balanced ownership.

## Why Kadena?

**Fairness**
As projects launch their tokens via traditional liquidity pools, token prices and fees quickly rise with higher demand. This model benefits the so-called “whales,” which can secure a large allocation regardless of cost and create an imbalance in token ownership. We believe this is an unsustainable fundraising model. Our platform will bring transparency and fairness to all participants.

**Cost**

Cost in blockchain ecosystems has quickly risen to record highs and made it almost impossible for the everyday user to participate — countless times, we’ve seen fees cost more than the actual transfer amount. It slows down the pace of innovation and adoption. With that in mind, users will interact with the Backalley platform at practically zero cost, 
thanks to the incredible innovation with Chainweb.

**Security**
Blockchain ecosystems have experienced countless hacks over the past months, and transaction costs have skyrocketed. Others have shut down for hours due to a weaker and centralized security model. We think decentralized apps need to be built on a secure, scalable, and cheap platform to be accessible to all. Kadena’s Chainweb protocol and the Pact programming language have an incredible amount of sophistication to put us in that direction.

**Community**
Kadena’s community has shown over the last months an incredible amount of support and dedication in building a vibrant ecosystem like never seen anywhere else. We are happy to contribute to this transformation and super excited to show you what we made over the last months!

**What comes next?**
We are super excited about our platform development thus far, and we are rapidly approaching our launch date! You will hear more from us in the upcoming days, starting with a series of posts to give you more details about the platform’s look and functionalities!
